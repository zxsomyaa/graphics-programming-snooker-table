# Graphics Programming – Snooker Table

A physics-based snooker table simulation developed using **p5.js** and **Matter.js**. This project focuses on real-time rendering, basic physics simulation, and user interaction, demonstrating core concepts in graphics programming and game mechanics.

The project was developed as part of a graphics programming coursework and showcases practical implementation of motion, collision handling, and interactive visual design using JavaScript.
