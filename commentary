This snooker game uses a fully mouse-based cue control system to provide intuitive and accessible interaction. Players can drag the cue ball to reposition it when allowed (`isDraggingcueBalll` and `iscueBalllInPlay`), and shoot by clicking and dragging away from the cue ball. The drag direction and distance determine the direction and magnitude of force applied using `Body.applyForce()` from Matter.js. A visual force line (`drawForceLinee`) helps players aim and control power. Keyboard input was deliberately avoided to ensure a smoother, more natural interaction model that aligns with how users expect to play physics-based games. At the start of the game, players are prompted to enter their initials, which are displayed dynamically during each turn to personalize the experience (`playerTurnDisplay`). Several game modes are included: `'starting'` for the standard triangle formation, `'randomReds'` and `'randomAll'` for unpredictable setups, and `'straightLine'` for practice. Players can toggle between these using keys 1–4, with each reset handled through `resetBalls()`. A unique visual extension is the flame trail added to the cue ball using `drawFlameeTrail()`. It uses `cueBalllHistory` and `lerpColor()` to create a red-yellow trail that visually intensifies with movement, enhancing gameplay feedback and immersion. Ball-pocket interactions are handled in `checkAndPotBalls()` with animations using `pockettAnimation()`. Coloured balls reset to their original positions, red balls are removed from the game, and if the cue ball is potted, it is repositioned using `resetcueBalllPosition()`. The game also detects rule violations such as potting the same coloured ball consecutively via `checkAndUpdateConsecutivee()`. Visual elements like the live player turn display, power bar (`drawPowerBar()`), and real-time collision messages (`updatesMessagess()`) enhance the user experience. Overall, this game balances realistic physics with arcade-style visuals, offering an engaging, polished, and rule-driven snooker simulation with immersive feedback and unique extensions.
